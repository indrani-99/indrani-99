<h1 align="center">Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Indrani Paul</h1>

<p>
  Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a <b>Dynamic Full Stack Web Developer</b>b with over <b>1200 hours</b> of hands-on coding experience. Specializing in the <b>MERN stack</b>, I thrive in both solo and collaborative environments, consistently delivering innovative and high-quality solutions.
</p>
<p>
  I completed my B.Tech in <b>Computer Science & Engineering</b> in 2023. During my job search, I realized that while I had a solid theoretical foundation, I needed more practical experience to build impactful projects. So, I joined <b>Masai School</b>, where I dedicated the past 11 months to honing my practical skills. I learned a wide range of technologies, developed numerous individual and collaborative projects, and sharpened my skills in <b>Data Structures & Algorithms</b>. I also focused on improving my soft skills to seamlessly fit into any dynamic work environment. ðŸ’ª
</p>
<p>
  Now, Iâ€™m excited and ready to embark on my career as a developer. I'm looking for a great opportunity where I can leverage my skills to create something amazing and enhance user experiences. If you're seeking a passionate and dedicated developer eager to make a difference, let's connect! ðŸš€
